# Icons Directory

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:
- icon-16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon-32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon-48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon-128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, placeholder icons can be used. In production, these should be replaced with proper AI Focus Lens branded icons that represent the accessibility and focus detection functionality.

The icons should follow Chrome extension design guidelines and be clearly visible against both light and dark backgrounds.
